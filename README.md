## Description

Python package for conditional density estimation. It either wraps or
implements diverse conditional density estimators.

### Density estimation with normalizing flows

This package provides pass-through access to all the
functionalities of [nflows](https://github.com/bayesiains/nflows).

## Setup

Clone the repo and install all the dependencies using the
`environment.yml` file to create a conda environment: `conda env
create -f environment.yml`. If you already have a `pyknos` environment
and want to refresh dependencies, just run `conda env update -f
environment.yml --prune`.

Alternatively, you can install via `setup.py` using `pip install -e
".[dev]"` (the dev flag installs development and testing
dependencies).

## Examples

Examples are collected in notebooks in `examples/`.

## Binary files and Jupyter notebooks

### Using

We use git lfs to store large binary files. Those files are not
downloaded by cloning the repository, but you have to pull them
separately. To do so follow installation instructions here
[https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/). In
particular, in a freshly cloned repository on a new machine, you will
need to run both `git-lfs install` and `git-lfs pull`.

### Contributing

We use a filename filter to identify large binary files. Once you
installed and pulled git lfs you can add a file to git lfs by
appending `_gitlfs` to the basename, e.g., `oldbase_gitlfs.npy`. Then
add the file to the index, commit, and it will be tracked by git lfs.

Additionally, to avoid large diffs due to Jupyter notebook outputs we
are using `nbstripout` to remove output from notebooks before every
commit. The `nbstripout` package is downloaded automatically during
installation of `pyknos`. However, **please make sure to set up the
filter yourself**, e.g., through `nbstriout --install` or with
different options as described
[here](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout).

## Name

pyknós (πυκνός) is the transliterated Greek root for density
(pyknótita) and also means *sagacious*.
